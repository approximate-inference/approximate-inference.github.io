abstract: 'Simulation-based inference with neural posterior estimation (NPE) often yields overconfident and unreliable posteriors under       
           limited simulation budgets. To address this, we propose
          DRO-NPE, a distributionally robust approach that replaces the standard NPE objective
          with a worst-case loss over a Wasserstein ambiguity set. We introduce KL-based metrics for
          miscoverage and miscalibration, and use these to show that the DRO-NPE objective controls
          overfitting and reduces posterior overconfidence. Our method is tractable, parallelisable, and
          readily integrates with standard normalising flows. Across benchmark SBI tasks, DRO-NPE
          consistently improves coverage and calibration, while narrowing the gap between empirical
          and population NPE loss, leading to more reliable inference in low-simulation regimes.'
